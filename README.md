# Linux Shell Configuration Files
---------------------------------

The list of my configuration files. Each file should be dropped into its
corresponding path.


## Use

1. Clone the repository, and then
2. Run the following command to setup the configuration files:

```console
$ make deploy
```

Updates or custom installations can be achieved by updating the local repository on
the custom branch or tag, and then running `make deploy` again. Another option would be
to simply download the code and run the same command.

## Vim

This configuration has its own repository, for my custom `Vim`
configuration check [rmariano vim](https://github.com/rmariano/vim-config).
